            So lately, I've had quite some ups but mostly downs. I actually uh... had a high up, I had it all good actually. It was the best highlight of my life... there were two things that mattered to me most, then out of nowhere, it started to dissapear one by one... I guess thigs happened and well now I got nothing, but that's just how life is you know... But because of those past events I have made my own life moto which goes like this: "Everything is temporary, you either learn that the hard way or you don't", and guess what? I learned that the hard way. But in the end... we just have to keep pushing forward...
